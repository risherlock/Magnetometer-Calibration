% Plots ellipsoid from coefficients of general quadrics equation
% Result of whole night discussion with Manjul (2020/6/8-9) 
%
% Input:
%   v = [a,b,c,f,g,h,p,q,r,d], a vector corresponding to coefficients of 
%       the general quadric surface given by equation,  
%       ax2 + by2 + cz2 + 2fyz + 2gxz + 2hxy + 2px + 2qy + 2rz + d = 0.
%
% Notes:
% 1.General ellipsoid in matrix form: X'*M*X + [2p,2q,2r]*X + d = 0
%   where,
%       X = [x,y,z]
%       M = [a h g; h b f; g f c]
%
% 2.Diagonalizing above matrix M to M_ rotates the general ellipsoid such 
%   that its axes aligns with new coordinate axes defined by eigenvectors.
%   New ellipsoid: X'*C'*M*C*X + [2p,2q,2r]*C*X + d = 0
%   where,    
%       C  = Eigenvector matrix of M (DCM from old to new coordinates)
%       M_ = C'*M*C= New ellipsoid diagonal matrix
%
%
% 3.Semi principal axes (ax,by,cz) for ellipsoid with no rotation
%       ax = sqrt(p^2/a^2 + q^2/(a*b) + r^2/(a*c) - d/a);
%       by = sqrt(p^2/(a*b) + q^2/b^2 + r^2/(b*c) - d/b);
%       cz = sqrt(p^2/(a*c) + q^2/(b*c) + r^2/c^2 - d/c);
%   here, f = 0, g = 0 and h = 0
%
% Steps:
%   1) Diagonalize M matrix using eigenvector of M, M_ = C'*M*C
%   2) Find p,q,r of new matrix, [p_,q_,r_] = [p,q,r]*C
%   3) Find semi principal axes ax_,ay_,az_ for f = g = h = 0
%   4) Generate points of ellipsoid using parametric equation
%   5) Rotate the points using DCM, C
%   6) Plot the points

f = v(4); g = v(5); h = v(6);

d = v(10); 

% Coordinate frame transformation i.e diagonalize M 
M =[a h g; h b f; g f c]; % Original ellipsoid matrix 
[evec,~]=eig(M); % Compute eigenvectors matrix
C = evec; % DCM = eigenvectors matrix 
M_ = C'*M*C; % Diagonalize M

% Coefficients of the ellipsoid in new frame
% Note the ellipsoid is not rotating in this new frame so f, g and h = 0

b_ = M_(2,2);
c_ = M_(3,3);
p_ = pqr_(1);
q_ = pqr_(2);
r_ = pqr_(3);
d_ = d;

% Semi principal axes (Still no rotation)
ax_ = sqrt(p_^2/a_^2 + q_^2/(a_*b_) + r_^2/(a_*c_) - d_/a_);
bx_ = sqrt(p_^2/(a_*b_) + q_^2/b_^2 + r_^2/(b_*c_) - d_/b_);
cx_ = sqrt(p_^2/(a_*c_) + q_^2/(b_*c_) + r_^2/c_^2 - d_/c_);

% Centre of the ellipsoid
centre = M\[-p, -q, -r]';

% Generate ellipsoid points
theta = linspace(0,2*pi,20);
phi = linspace(0,pi,20);
[theta,phi] = meshgrid(theta,phi);
x_ = ax_*cos(theta).*cos(phi);
y_ = bx_*cos(theta).*sin(phi);
z_ = cx_*sin(theta);

%%% Note
% Till now we have extracted all the information from the
% input coefficients of ellipsoid. We generated the points of ellipsoid 
% too. It must be remembered that these points are described in the 
% coordinate represented by eigenvectors where there is no rotation of 
% ellipsoid. Now all that remains is to rotate each points using DCM (C) 
% that we found above.
